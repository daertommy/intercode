        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi larp community! A thing happened that we should tell you about. You're receiving this because you've logged into at least one convention website running in NEIL Hosting (Intercon, Be-Con, Festival, Bubble, etc).</p><p>While reviewing the code in the Intercode open source project, we discovered a backup of the Intercode production database. This backup was publicly available for about 6 weeks between September 18 and November 3, 2022.</p><p>We do not store payment card data in this database. In addition, we use industry-standard password hashing to protect passwords. <strong>Nevertheless, we recommend that you change your password as a precaution. To change your password, please visit: <a href="https://www.neilhosting.net/users/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.neilhosting.net/users/edit</a></strong></p><p>We do not have any evidence that this data was accessed, and we have taken steps to remove it from the Internet. However, we also have no way to prove that the data was not accessed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_oYvA" id="what-data-was-publicly-accessible">What data was publicly accessible?<a href="#what-data-was-publicly-accessible" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What data was publicly accessible?" title="Direct link to What data was publicly accessible?">​</a></h2><ul><li>Information in User Profiles for all conventions hosted on this instance, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, birth dates (if provided), etc:<ul><li>These conventions include but are not limited to: Intercon, Festival of the LARPs, Bubble, SLAW, Summer Larpin', Be-Con, NELCO, Winter Boffer Con, Wintercon, and others. Refer to <a href="https://www.neilhosting.net/pages/all-conventions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.neilhosting.net/pages/all-conventions</a> for a more complete list.</li></ul></li><li>Encrypted passwords for all user accounts. Passwords are hashed and salted using the industry-standard bcrypt algorithm.</li><li>Event proposals, signups, dropped events, individual event ratings (starred/hidden events), and all other data used in the signup system for Intercode-hosted conventions.</li><li>Historical data from past conventions, including previous addresses, names, phone numbers, and anything else attendees might have entered into profiles and not updated on that convention site.</li><li>Lists of user activity alerts set up by admins of current and prior conventions.</li><li>Sales records for tickets and merchandise at current and past conventions.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_oYvA" id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?<a href="#how-did-this-happen" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How did this happen?" title="Direct link to How did this happen?">​</a></h2><p>Prior to resetting the Intercon U signups and schedule, Nat took a manual export of the full database for safety. This is outside our standard backup procedure, which uses Amazon's automated database snapshot feature and stores backups in a separate secure environment.</p><p>The manual export file stayed on Nat's computer while he developed the COVID mask protocol features for Intercode that we're currently using at Intercon U. When checking the new code into the repository, Nat accidentally included the export.</p><p>The day before Intercon U signups opened for the first round, while reviewing unrelated code in preparation for the signups opening, Nat noticed the file on Github and immediately began taking steps to remove it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_oYvA" id="what-are-we-doing-about-this">What are we doing about this?<a href="#what-are-we-doing-about-this" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are we doing about this?" title="Direct link to What are we doing about this?">​</a></h2><p>We have purged all known copies of this file from the public Internet. We've also reached out to the Consequences web team, who we believe accidentally received this file as part of their regular Intercode releases, and asked them to purge it from their systems. We also searched some of the places on the Internet where stolen data often appears to see if the Intercode export may have ended up there, and weren't able to find it.</p><p>We've also added some additional protections to our code repository and data export process to make it much less likely that a similar incident could occur in the future.</p><p>We held a post-mortem meeting to discuss this incident and document it. The meeting notes are available at: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hcVCF9wzqpTevZPlImRUjhTONp4hFqgjcQhWER4Ao7M/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hcVCF9wzqpTevZPlImRUjhTONp4hFqgjcQhWER4Ao7M/edit?usp=sharing</a></p><p>We're also sending this email to all Intercode users to let them know. <strong>Again, we recommend that you change your password using the link above.</strong></p><p>We recognize the potential severity of this data exposure. We'd like to apologize deeply. We understand the importance of data security, and we should not have allowed this to happen. Transparency is important to us, and if you have any questions about this, we'd be more than happy to chat with you.</p><p>Nat Budin (he/him)<br>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey all. This thing happened we should tell you about.</p><p>While performing platform upgrades, we found a bug in Intercode, the website code used by conventions such as Intercon. It has since been fixed.</p><p>This bug created an exploit where people with leadership access to one Intercode convention could use certain permissions on any convention. As a reminder, not even admins have access to your passwords or financial information.</p><p>Due to the technical complexity of accessing the exploit and the small number of people who had the permissions required to take advantage of this, we don’t think it was used, but can’t prove it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_oYvA" id="what-happened">What Happened?<a href="#what-happened" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Happened?" title="Direct link to What Happened?">​</a></h2><p>It’s technically possible con leadership from one convention looked at or modified information for conventions they should not have had access to. We don’t think anyone did, and it’s since been fixed, but here’s the low down.</p><p>There’s a function called “Become user” which certain people on the convention team have permissions for. Just like it sounds, it lets people see the convention website as if they were logged in as the selected user. It’s used for things like running the convention, debugging, and accessing the website on behalf of a user at their request. It does not allow access to anyone’s passwords or payment information.</p><p>This permission is fairly restricted and convention specific. That being said, if you had Become user permissions on one convention using Intercode, it turns out there was a way to then Become user on any Intercode convention. It would involve coding and would not be easy, but it was possible. For example, someone with admin access to Intercon S could have accessed admin functions on Be-Con 2019, including viewing and modifying event and attendee data.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_oYvA" id="what-are-we-doing-about-this">What Are We Doing About This?<a href="#what-are-we-doing-about-this" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Are We Doing About This?" title="Direct link to What Are We Doing About This?">​</a></h2><p>The bug has been fixed and the exploit is gone. We’ve also reviewed the list of people who have Become user permissions on any Intercode site. Considering the difficulty of finding the exploit, the technical expertise required to use it, and the limited set of people who have the necessary permissions, we think it’s really unlikely anyone did so. That being said, we can’t prove a negative.</p><p>A post-mortem was held to document the exploit, which you can find at: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov8jFIpExWn-elUBXtRd22BwoIQGSbWMFio_iTL9IRM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov8jFIpExWn-elUBXtRd22BwoIQGSbWMFio_iTL9IRM/edit?usp=sharing</a>. It includes timelines and technical details for the interested.</p><p>And of course, we’re now telling you about it. We take the safety and security of our community very seriously, which means owning up to our mistakes. We apologize this happened at all, and we're even more sorry it took us so long to notice it.</p><p>Thanks for your faith in us.</p><p>The Intercode Team<br>
