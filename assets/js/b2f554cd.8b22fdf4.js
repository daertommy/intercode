A thing happened that we should tell you about. You\'re receiving this because you\'ve logged into at least one convention website running in NEIL Hosting (Intercon, Be-Con, Festival, Bubble, etc).\\n\\nWhile reviewing the code in the Intercode open source project, we discovered a backup of the Intercode production database. This backup was publicly available for about 6 weeks between September 18 and November 3, 2022.\\n\\nWe do not store payment card data in this database. In addition, we use industry-standard password hashing to protect passwords. **Nevertheless, we recommend that you change your password as a precaution. To change your password, please visit: https://www.neilhosting.net/users/edit**\\n\\nWe do not have any evidence that this data was accessed, and we have taken steps to remove it from the Internet. However, we also have no way to prove that the data was not accessed.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What data was publicly accessible?\\n\\n- Information in User Profiles for all conventions hosted on this instance, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, birth dates (if provided), etc:\\n  - These conventions include but are not limited to: Intercon, Festival of the LARPs, Bubble, SLAW, Summer Larpin\', Be-Con, NELCO, Winter Boffer Con, Wintercon, and others. Refer to https://www.neilhosting.net/pages/all-conventions for a more complete list.\\n- Encrypted passwords for all user accounts. Passwords are hashed and salted using the industry-standard bcrypt algorithm.\\n- Event proposals, signups, dropped events, individual event ratings (starred/hidden events), and all other data used in the signup system for Intercode-hosted conventions.\\n- Historical data from past conventions, including previous addresses, names, phone numbers, and anything else attendees might have entered into profiles and not updated on that convention site.\\n- Lists of user activity alerts set up by admins of current and prior conventions.\\n- Sales records for tickets and merchandise at current and past conventions.\\n\\n## How did this happen?\\n\\nPrior to resetting the Intercon U signups and schedule, Nat took a manual export of the full database for safety. This is outside our standard backup procedure, which uses Amazon\'s automated database snapshot feature and stores backups in a separate secure environment.\\n\\nThe manual export file stayed on Nat\'s computer while he developed the COVID mask protocol features for Intercode that we\'re currently using at Intercon U. When checking the new code into the repository, Nat accidentally included the export.\\n\\nThe day before Intercon U signups opened for the first round, while reviewing unrelated code in preparation for the signups opening, Nat noticed the file on Github and immediately began taking steps to remove it.\\n\\n## What are we doing about this?\\n\\nWe have purged all known copies of this file from the public Internet. We\'ve also reached out to the Consequences web team, who we believe accidentally received this file as part of their regular Intercode releases, and asked them to purge it from their systems. We also searched some of the places on the Internet where stolen data often appears to see if the Intercode export may have ended up there, and weren\'t able to find it.\\n\\nWe\'ve also added some additional protections to our code repository and data export process to make it much less likely that a similar incident could occur in the future.\\n\\nWe held a post-mortem meeting to discuss this incident and document it. The meeting notes are available at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hcVCF9wzqpTevZPlImRUjhTONp4hFqgjcQhWER4Ao7M/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\nWe\'re also sending this email to all Intercode users to let them know. **Again, we recommend that you change your password using the link above.**\\n\\nWe recognize the potential severity of this data exposure. We\'d like to apologize deeply. We understand the importance of data security, and we should not have allowed this to happen. Transparency is important to us, and if you have any questions about this, we\'d be more than happy to chat with you.\\n\\nNat Budin (he/him)<br />\\nDave Kapell (he/him)<br />\\nJae Hartwin (crow/crows)<br />\\nJohn Cooke (he/him)"},{"id":"/2022/01/18/graphql-cross-domain-security-issue-disclosure","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/01/18/graphql-cross-domain-security-issue-disclosure","editUrl":"https://github.com/neinteractiveliterature/intercode/edit/main/doc-site/blog/blog/2022-01-18-graphql-cross-domain-security-issue-disclosure.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-18-graphql-cross-domain-security-issue-disclosure.md","title":"GraphQL Cross-Domain Security Issue Disclosure","description":"Hey all.

This thing happened we should tell you about.\\n\\nWhile performing platform upgrades, we found a bug in Intercode, the website code used by conventions such as Intercon. It has since been fixed.\\n\\nThis bug created an exploit where people with leadership access to one Intercode convention could use certain permissions on any convention. As a reminder, not even admins have access to your passwords or financial information.\\n\\nDue to the technical complexity of accessing the exploit and the small number of people who had the permissions required to take advantage of this, we don\u2019t think it was used, but can\u2019t prove it.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What Happened?\\n\\nIt\u2019s technically possible con leadership from one convention looked at or modified information for conventions they should not have had access to. We don\u2019t think anyone did, and it\u2019s since been fixed, but here\u2019s the low down.\\n\\nThere\u2019s a function called \u201cBecome user\u201d which certain people on the convention team have permissions for. Just like it sounds, it lets people see the convention website as if they were logged in as the selected user. It\u2019s used for things like running the convention, debugging, and accessing the website on behalf of a user at their request. It does not allow access to anyone\u2019s passwords or payment information.\\n\\nThis permission is fairly restricted and convention specific. That being said, if you had Become user permissions on one convention using Intercode, it turns out there was a way to then Become user on any Intercode convention. It would involve coding and would not be easy, but it was possible. For example, someone with admin access to Intercon S could have accessed admin functions on Be-Con 2019, including viewing and modifying event and attendee data.\\n\\n## What Are We Doing About This?\\n\\nThe bug has been fixed and the exploit is gone. We\u2019ve also reviewed the list of people who have Become user permissions on any Intercode site. Considering the difficulty of finding the exploit, the technical expertise required to use it, and the limited set of people who have the necessary permissions, we think it\u2019s really unlikely anyone did so. That being said, we can\u2019t prove a negative.\\n\\nA post-mortem was held to document the exploit, which you can find at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov8jFIpExWn-elUBXtRd22BwoIQGSbWMFio_iTL9IRM/edit?usp=sharing. It includes timelines and technical details for the interested.\\n\\nAnd of course, we\u2019re now telling you about it. We take the safety and security of our community very seriously, which means owning up to our mistakes. We apologize this happened at all, and we\'re even more sorry it took us so long to notice it.\\n\\nThanks for your faith in us.\\n\\nThe Intercode Team<br />\\nNat Budin (he/him)<br />\\nDave Kapell (he/him)<br />\\nJae Hartwin (they/them)<br />\\nMarleigh Norton (she/her)"},{"id":"/2020/03/15/email-forwarding","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/03/15/email-forwarding","editUrl":"https://github.com/neinteractiveliterature/intercode/edit/main/doc-site/blog/blog/2020-03-15-email-forwarding.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-03-15-email-forwarding.md","title":"Email forwarding","description":"Intercode can now forward emails recieved by a convention domain to appropriate staff members.
